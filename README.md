# Purpose<br>
A professional portfolio website that includes an 'About', 'Work', and 'Contact' section. This portfolio will serve as a first development for a portfolio and will continue to be developed as more projects and content are applicable.<br>
<br>
# User Story <br>
AS AN employer<br>
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples<br>
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position<br>
<br>
# Acceptance Criteria <br>
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work<br>
WHEN I load their portfolio<br>
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them<br>
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section<br>
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications<br>
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application<br>
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others<br>
WHEN I click on the images of the applications<br>
THEN I am taken to that deployed application<br>
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices<br>
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport<br>
<br>
# Features <br>
This portfolio website allows for navigation between the elements (About Me, Work, and Contact Me) as well as linking to external applications (i.e., Run-Buddy, Horiseon-Marketing, and Placehold webpages). This page also allows for navigation to the user's resume.<br>
